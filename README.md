## 🧠 About the Project

This project helps **Flutter developers** and learners understand how each built-in `Curves` function affects motion over time.  
Each easing curve changes the animation’s speed and timing — this site lets you **see and feel** those effects visually.

Example curves include:
- `linear`
- `easeIn`, `easeOut`, `easeInOut`
- `bounceIn`, `bounceOut`
- `elasticIn`, `elasticOut`
- and many more!
